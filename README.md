# What is the Alpine.js file structure?
  Alpine.js has no file structure also, it doesn’t currently have a CLI. We can expect that in the future, where they can give us a CLI tool we can use to scaffold a quick Alpine.js project. Just like Vue.js CLI does.For now, we manually create the files and templates and add the Alpine.js library. Since Alpine.js and Vue.js are similar in syntax, we can mimic the Vue.js file structure in our Alpine.js projects.
